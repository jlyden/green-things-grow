        <h1>Static vs. Dynamic</h1>
        <h2>Static</h2>
        <p>A static webpage doesn't change - it always looks the same
        no matter who is looking at it. The user can click links to go 
        to other webpages, but the user cannot change the page.</p>
        
        <p>Static doesn't mean boring or ugly. You can use CSS to 
        completely change the look of a page without building the 
        content on the fly. See 
        <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> 
        for amazing examples of how lovely a static webpage can be.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic</h2>
        <p>A dynamic webpage is built "on the fly" - when the user 
        visits it, the page is created on the spot, possibly uniquely 
        targeting that user based on user-specific data.</p>
